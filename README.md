# lilREPL

lilREPL is a small project that allows me to learn rust libraries

## Goals:

1. Simple input output reading and displaying (done with helper_fn)
2. Saving user input (done with the use of Vectors)
3. Adding some data retrieval [single, all] (done all with view_stored_profiles)
4. File access through the Repl
5. File navigation with user choice
